# Books-Library

Simple (Minimalistic) JavaScript Single Page App (SPA) without a Framework

Written by Svetlin Nakov in 2015 (before the modern JavaScript era).

The "Books Library" JS frontend app is based:
 - HTML + CSS + JavaScript + jQuery
 - Kinvey (Backend as a Service)
 - Consuming RESTful services (AJAX + REST + JSON) and DOM manipulation

**Minimalistic approach**: no framework, no templating, no routing, just executing AJAX calls and changing the DOM tree

Used to train beginners in JavaScript frontend apps.
